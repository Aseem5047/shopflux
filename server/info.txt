The same stream can be consumed by multiple workers, and each worker decides what logic to run for a specific event type in that stream.

🔁 What actually happens step-by-step

1️⃣ Event is published (once)
XADD auth:events * type USER_REGISTERED userId=123


This event:

Exists once

Is immutable

Lives in the stream forever (or until trimmed)

2️⃣ Multiple workers read the SAME stream

Example:

Worker	Stream	Consumer Group
Wallet	auth:events	wallet-auth-group
Email	auth:events	email-auth-group
Analytics	auth:events	analytics-auth-group

👉 Same stream, different groups

3️⃣ Each worker gets the event independently

Internally Redis does this:

auth:events
 ├── group: wallet-auth-group  → delivered
 ├── group: email-auth-group   → delivered
 └── group: analytics-auth-group → delivered


Acknowledging in one group does nothing to the others.

4️⃣ Worker decides what to do (this is key)

Inside each worker:

const eventHandlers = {
  USER_REGISTERED: handleUserRegistered,
  PASSWORD_RESET: handlePasswordReset,
};


So when an event arrives:

if (handler exists for this type) {
  run logic
} else {
  ignore
}


👉 Workers do not care about events they don’t understand.

🧠 Important subtle point (very important)

Workers do NOT subscribe to specific events.
They subscribe to streams.

Filtering by event type is your application logic, not Redis’s job.

Redis only guarantees:

Delivery

Ordering (per stream)

Reliability
